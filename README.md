# Staffeli — DIKU Support Tools for Canvas LMS

``Staffeli'' is the Danish word for an easel — a wooden frame for holding up a
canvas. These tools leverage the [Canvas LMS REST
API](https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/index.html) to create a more
pleasant experience when with the Canvas LMS as used at
[DIKU](http://diku.dk/), also known as [Absalon](https://absalon.ku.dk/).
